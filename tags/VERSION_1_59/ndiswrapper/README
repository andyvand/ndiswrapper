What is it?
===========

Some vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or provide
a Linux driver for their wireless network cards. This project provides
a Linux kernel module that loads and runs NDIS (Windows network driver
API) drivers supplied by the vendors

Status
======

Many cards work; see
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/List
for details.

Installation
============

See INSTALL for a short version of installation instructions. More
up-to-date instructions, as well as FAQ etc., can be found at
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?Installation.

Problems
========

Read documentation at http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki.

Before sending bug reports, please check archives of mailing list and
public forum available at project home page:
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net. Both these have search facility.
Follow the instructions below when sending a bug report:

   * Recompile with 'make DEBUG=3' and reload ndiswrapper module.
     Report dmesg output. Without this step, proper feedback may not be
     possible.  Include details about your card, chipset (reported by lspci),
     distribution, kernel version in the post.

   * Check if latest SVN works.

   * Use an alternate windows driver; see the link in Status section above
     for a driver that is known to work for your chipset. You may also
     find more information in the Wiki.

ndiswrapper (version 0.4)

What is it?
===========

Some vendors refuses to release specs or even a binary linux-driver
for their WLAN cards. This project tries to solve this problem by
making a kernel module that can load Ndis (windows network driver API)
drivers.


Status
======

The following chipsets are known to work:
   * Broadcom (4301, 94306)
   * Intel Centrino (2100)
   * Admtek (8211)
   * Atheros (AR5004)


Installation
============

See the INSTALL document for instruction on how to compile and install
ndiswrapper.

Problems
========

Note that the project is still evolving. Support for working with
other wireless tools (e.g., monitoring tools) is very limited at the
moment.

Before sending bug reports, please check archives of mailing list and
public forum available at project home page:
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net. Follow the instructions below when
sending a bug report:

   * Enable DEBUG option the Makefile in driver directory and
     recompile all sources. Report dmesg output. Without this step,
     proper feedback may not be possible.  Include details about your
     card, chipset (reported by lspci), distribution, kernel version
     in the post.

   * Check if latest CVS works.

   * Check the archives of mailing list and the forum for any solution
     to similar problems. Both these have search facility.

   * Use alternate windows driver; see the 'Supported Cards' page on
     the project homepage for a driver that is known to work for your
     chipset.

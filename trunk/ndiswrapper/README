* Quickstart guide *
====================

1. Compile the driver
---------------------
You need a recent 2.6.0 or 2.4 kernel with source.
The driver has known problems with SMP and will not work reliably with it.

Go to the driver directory.

a) If you are running 2.6 kernel, run:

   > make

   This will produce ndiswrapper.ko

b) If you are using a 2.4 kernel, run:

   > make -f Makefile.24

   This will produce a ndiswrapper.o

2. Compile the loader:
----------------------
You need flex tool. 
Go to the utils directory and run (irrepsecitve of what kernel you are
running):

> make

This should produce a loaddriver executable.

3. Get the windows driver
-------------------------
Download the Windows XP drivers for your card and locate the .sys and
.inf file. Copy these files some place.
   
4. Find out the PCI vendor and device of you WLAN card.
-------------------------------------------------------

You can do this step in two ways. 

a) Run

   > lspci -n | grep `lspci | awk '/802.11/ {print $1}'` | awk  '{print $4}

   This should produce output such as '14e4:4301'. If it does, then the
   vendor ID is 14e4 and device ID is 4301. 

b) If step a) fails, or if you want to do it manually, run

   > lspci
   ...
   00:0a.2 FLASH memory: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 0510
   00:0c.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4301 802.11b (rev 02)
   00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c940 1000Base? (rev 12)
   ...

   In this example, 00:0c.0 is the PCI ID of the wireless card. This
   varies from system to system. An easy way to look for the card is to
   grep for 802.11:

   > lspci | grep 802.11
   00:0c.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4301 802.11b (rev 02)

   Now look for vendor id and driver id for the same card:

   > lspci -n
   ...
   00:0a.2 Class 0501: 1524:0510
   00:0c.0 Class 0280: 14e4:4301 (rev 02)
   00:0d.0 Class 0200: 10b7:1700 (rev 12)
   ...

   Here, the second line begins with the PCI ID noted above: 00:0c.0

   So the vendor ID is 14e4 and the device ID is 4301 in this case.

5. Load the kernel module
-------------------------

From the ndiswrapper directory,

a) If you are running 2.6 kernel, run:

   > insmod driver/ndiswrapper.ko

b) If you are running 2.4 kernel, run:

   > insmod driver/ndiswrapper.o

6. Load the windows driver
--------------------------
From the ndiswrapper directory, run:

> utils/loaddriver <vendor> <device> <sysfile> <inffile>

where <vendor> is the vendor ID and <device> is the device ID noted in
step 4, <sysfile> is the full path to the .sys file and <inffile> is the
full path to .inf file of the windows driver copied in step 3.

If you get no error the driver should now be loaded and active.

7. Configure interface
----------------------
Use iwconfig to configure wireless network interface. First, locate
the wireless interface:

> iwconfig

This will print the wireless interface (eth0 or eth1 or eth2 ...). In
the examples below ethX is used; replace ethX with the interface
reported by iwconfig above.

Set the operating mode of the interface according to your setup. In
most cases, it is Managed: 

> iwconfig ethX mode Managed

If you use encryption (WEP), set the key:

> iwconfig ethX key XXXXXXXX

(You can use 6 hex digits for 40-bit encryption or 10  hex digits for
128-bit encryption).

Set the SSID:

> iwconfig ethX essid ESSID

Replace ESSID with the SSID used by your AP (access point or router).

Now, setup the network parameters for the interface ethX. This varies
from distribution to distribution. Refer to your distribution's
documents on how to do this. Once this is done, you can use network
tools to bring up the network; e.g.,

> ifup ethX

or

> ifconfig ethX up

8. Automate
-----------
When you have a wokring setup you may want to automate the driver-loading

a) You need to copy the ndiswrapper module (produced in step 1) to
   your kernel's modules directory. For this, create the misc
   directory in the appropriate place:

   > mkdir /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/misc

   Copy ndiswrapper.o file if you are running 2.4 kernel, or
   ndiswrapper.ko file if you are running 2.6 kernel to the misc
   directory created above:

   > cp driver/ndiswrapper.*o /lib/modules/$(uname -r) misc

   Update module information:

   > depmod -a

   Copy the loaddriver executable to some place, e.g., /usr/local/bin:

   > cp utils/loaddriver /usr/local/bin

   Copy the .inf file and .sys file to some place, e.g.,
   /usr/local/share/ndiswrapper

   > cp bcmwl5.sys bcmwl5.inf /usr/local/share/ndiswrapper

b) Create alias for the interface:

   alias ethX ndiswrapper

c) For kernel 2.6:

   * First write a script that does insmod and loaddriver.

   * Add this line to /etc/modprobe.conf:

        install ethX <path to your script>

     Fedora Core 1 (and probably Redhat 9) with kernel 2.6.0 seem to
     have a slight bug which cause ifup to not recoginize the install
     line in modprobe.conf. See 
     http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=110415
     for more info and a patch.

   For kernel 2.4:

   * Add these line to /etc/modules.conf:

     post-install ethX /usr/local/bin/loaddriver <vendor> <device>  /usr/local/share/ndiswrapper/*.sys /usr/local/share/ndiswrapper/*.inf

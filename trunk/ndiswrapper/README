* Quickstart guide *
====================

1. Compile the driver
---------------------
* You need a recent 2.6.0 or 2.4 kernel with source!
* The driver has known problem with SMP and will not work reliably with it.

Go to the driver directory and run

> make

if you are using a 2.6 kernel or

> make -f Makefile.24

if you use a 2.4 kernel

This should produce a ndiswrapper.(k)o if all goes well.

2. Compile the loader:
----------------------
* You need flex.

Go to the utils directory and run:

> make

This should produce a loaddriver executable.

3. Get the windows driver
-------------------------
Download the Windows XP drivers for your card and locate the .sys and .inf file.
Copy these files some place.
   
4. Find out the PCI vendor and device of you WLAN card.
-------------------------------------------------------
> lspci
...
00:0a.2 FLASH memory: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 0510
00:0c.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4301 802.11b (rev 02) <--- This is my card. Now remember the bus and slot number (00:0c.0).
00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c940 1000Base? (rev 12)
...

> lspci -n

...
00:0a.2 Class 0501: 1524:0510
00:0c.0 Class 0280: 14e4:4301 (rev 02)  <--- Numerical id of my card.
00:0d.0 Class 0200: 10b7:1700 (rev 12)
...

The vendor is 14e4 and the device is is 4301.

5. Load the kernel module
-------------------------
> insmod driver/ndiswrapper.(k)o

6. Load the windows driver
--------------------------
Eg:
>utils/loadriver 14e4 4301 /path/to/bcmwl5.sys /path/to/bcmwl5.inf

If you get no error the driver should now be loaded and active.

7. Configure interface
----------------------
Use the normal ifconfig, iwconfig, dhclient etc.

I have noticed that iwconfig is rather picky about the order of the arguments so
until I have investigated why you should use the following format for your
iwconfig command:

#iwconfig ethX mode Managed essid someid

If you use vendor tools always make sure that mode is set to Managed.
Auto will not work!

8. Automate
-----------
When you have a wokring setup you may want to automate the driver-loading

For kernel 2.6 do:

* First write a script that does insmod and loaddriver.

* Add this line to /etc/modprobe.conf:
install ethX <path to your script>

Now you should be able to do modprobe ethX

Fedora Core 1 (and probably Redhat 9) with kernel 2.6.0 seem to have a slight
bug which cause ifup to not recoginize the install line in modprobe.conf. See 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=110415 for more info and
a patch.

For kernel 2.4 do:

* Add these line to /etc/modules.conf:
alias eth1 ndiswrapper
post-install ethX /path/to/loaddriver x y  /path/to/driver.sys /path/to/driver.inf

=======================
* Added support for Linux kernels up to 3.8

Version 1.57 2011-12-31
=======================
* Added support for Linux 2.6.35 - Linux 3.1
* Kernels as old as 2.6.14 are now supported
* IW_AUTH_MFP implemented
* Reserve stack before copying arguments when calling from Windows to Linux
  on x86_64
* Fixed memory corruption on module unload seen with Atheros and Marvell USB
  devices
* Fixed a kernel panic if there are many devices for one driver and one
  fails to initialize

Version 1.56 2010-02-10
=======================
* Fixed compilation with 2.6.31 and newer on i386
* Use /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf, not /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.

Version 1.55 2009-06-28
=======================
* Fixed compilation issues with recent kernels

Version 1.54 2009-01-21
=======================
* Fixed buffer overflows with nickname
* Compilation issues with 2.6.27 and 2.6.28 fixed

Version 1.53 2008-05-17
=======================
* Implemented va_list conversion for x86_64, which fixes oops in
  vsprintf() and vsnprintf().
* Fixed oops on unload if using our workqueue implementation with SMP enabled.
* Don't change the actual thread priority, just pretend it was changed.
* Implemented format string conversion for x86_64, so that Windows long
  is mapped to Linux int.
* Fixed most sparse warnings.
* Simplified code and build system to remove already broken support for
  Linux versions prior to 2.6.16.
* Added .size and .type for all functions in win2lin_stubs.S to improve
  backtrace on x86_64.
* Fixed rx key authentication sequence number conversion from Windows to
  Linux so WPA authentication doesn't sometimes go into re-key auth loop.

Version 1.52 2008-02-02
=======================
* Fixed kernel crash when CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ is enabled
* Compilation issues with current 2.6.25 kernel tree fixed

Version 1.51 2007-12-17
=======================
* Fixed an SMP issue that may cause ndiswrapper to stop transmitting packets
  after a while (noticed with Marvell Pre-N USB driver)

Version 1.50 2007-11-27
=======================
* Added support for 2.6.24-rcX kernels
* Fixed issue with changing mac address (with 'ifconfig <iface> hw ether
  <mac>') - its broken since 1.45-rc2. Now one can also edit appropriate .conf
  file to set the NetworkAddress setting to whatever mac address should be
  used by the driver (e.g., NetworkAddress|0123456789ab)
* Fixed kernel crash observed with mrv8335 in ad-hoc mode

Version 1.49 2007-10-27
=======================
* If a driver returns invalid MAC address (00:00:00:00:00) when
  queried with OID_802_3_CURRENT_ADDRESS (probably because
  NdisReadNetworkAddress returns NDIS_STATUS_FAILURE?), use
  OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS to get the correct address. This is required for
  some Atheros devices (e.g., AR5007EG)
* Fixed a kernel crash with non-preempt kernels (observed with acx111 driver)
* Preemption, as required by Windows, has been reimplemented. With this,
  ndiswrapper works with RT-preempt and non-preempt kernels
* Dropped support for 2.4 kernels (and very old 2.6 kernels)

Version 1.48 2007-09-19
=======================
* Support for 2.6.23 kernel
* Disassociation with wpa_supplicant is fixed (earlier, after disassociation,
  the driver and ndiswrapper would be configured differently, requiring
  unloading and reloading of ndiswrapper module)
* (Re)Association / (Re)Authentication issues with wpa_supplicant with
  2.6.23 kernels fixed
* Fixed an issue with 64-bit Broadcom drivers that cause ntos_wq worker thread
  to take up all the CPU in some cases

Version 1.47 2007-06-12
=======================
* Fixed random (occasional) crash issues with 64-bit drivers (observed with
  Broadcom driver)
* Fixed compilation issues with version 1.46

Version 1.46 2007-06-03
=======================
* Fixed crash with large transfers (bug in version 1.45)

Version 1.45 2007-05-28
=======================
* Fixes 'NOHZ: local_softirq_pending: 08' warnings from tickless
  kernels
* Fixed issue(s) with RT-preempt enabled kernels
* Fixed ndiswrapper script to handle installation of Intel 4965AGN
  driver (which apparently works with ndiswrapper)
* Fixed a warning when SLUB allocator is used
* Fixed kernel crash with PsCreateSystemThread that manifested with
  sis163u when preempt is enabled
* Changing MAC address with 'ifconfig <iface> hw ether' should work
  with all drivers now. If MAC address should be changed every time
  ndiswrapper is loaded, change 'NetworkAddress' setting, as explained
  in wiki entry 'Tips' (earlier 'mac_address' setting was used, but
  that no longer applies)
* Fixed an issue with some drivers (e.g., sis163u) that would stall
  after working for a while
* Fixed crashes when removing module with USB devices

Version 1.44 2007-05-17
=======================
* Fixed issues with Ubuntu kernels (where PREEMPT is not enabled)
* Issues with combination of DEBUG_PREEMPT and RT-preempt fixed
* Fixed issues with newer 64-bit Broadcom driver when more than 1GB RAM is
  present
* Added support for upcoming 2.6.22 kernels

Version 1.43 2007-04-30
=======================
* Fixed long standing memory allocation issues with some
  drivers, Atheros especially. With this fix, Atheros cards in MacBook
  with Core 2 Duo are known to work
* The above fix changes core architecture of ndiswrapper and improves
  memory allocation issues with all drivers, as well as executes
  mostly with bottom-half's enabled for better system response and
  performance. Many drivers have been tested to work with these
  changes; however, some drivers may have been broken
* Added support for Marvell Gigabit ethernet drivers (apparently
  in-kernel sky2 driver has some issues)

Version 1.42 2007-04-16
=======================
* Yet another SMP fix
* Bug fix related to events (no driver seems to be affected by this)

Version 1.41 2007-03-31
=======================
* Fixed soft-lockup issue when multiple network devices are used
* Fixed a bug when unloading driver
* Fixed issues with recent RT-preempt patch

Version 1.40 2007-03-29
=======================
* The workaround for large memory allocations (needed by Atheros drivers)
  with 2.6.19+ kernels, introduced in version 1.33, causes soft-lockup
  with SMP. This is now fixed.

Version 1.39 2007-03-23
=======================
* An SMP issue is fixed
* When initializing a card that supports 802.11a and either 802.11g or b, set
  the mode to 802.11g or b, as 802.11a is far less common
* Added support for driver for Atheros device with PCI ID 168C:1014
* Fixed issue with initializing athfmwdl driver (for Atheros USB cards)

Version 1.38 2007-02-28
=======================
* Fixed ndiswrapper script so it installs drivers for certain PCMCIA cards
  (which have bus type 8, instead of 5)
* Fixed compilation issues with 2.4 kernels

Version 1.37 2007-02-02
=======================
* This time, really fixed the ndiswrapper script for sis163u driver (wrong
  version was packaged with 1.36, although issue was fixed in svn a few days
  ago)

Version 1.36 2007-02-01
=======================
* Fixed ndiswrapper script (broken since 1.23 for sis163u driver)
* Implemented full scatter/gather lists (not tested)
* Implemented support for hardware TCP/IP checksumming (through NDIS)

Version 1.35 2007-01-28
=======================
* Fixed a bug with scatter/gather. With this rt61 from RaLink and VT6655 from
  VIA drivers transmit data. Other drivers that associated but didn't transmit
  data (e.g., RT8855, Airgo's Gen3 PCI with ID 17CB:0002) may also work.

Version 1.34 2007-01-08
=======================
* Provide workaround for large memory allocations in interrupt context with
  2.6.19+ kernels. With this, Atheros (and other?) drivers don't need kernel
  to be patched.

Version 1.33 2006-12-28
=======================
* Allow large memory allocations in older kernels; with 2.6.19 and newer
  kernels, vmalloc in atomic allocations is not allowed (see 'patches' section
  on project page for workaround on these newer kernels).

Version 1.32 2006-12-23
=======================
* Added compatibility with 2.6.20-rc1 kernel
* Fixed crash when changing MAC address (with 'ifconfig hw ether')
* Fixed crash when names of other network device are changed (e.g., by udev)

Version 1.31 2006-12-05
=======================
* Fixed crashes with shutting down computer without unloading ndiswrapper
  module.
* Added support for Davicom 9601 USB ethernet device.
* Fixed ndiswrapper script to show correct device IDs.

Version 1.30 2006-11-28
=======================
* Yet another fix to ndiswrapper script (to handle file names with upper case
  extensions).

Version 1.29 2006-11-23
=======================
* Fixed ndiswrapper script to handle INF files properly.
* Added support for Atheros 5416 (802.11n) chipset.

Version 1.28 2006-10-29
=======================
* Windows drivers may request firmware to be loaded in either upper or lower
  case (either full name or partially). Instead of using given name, use
  installed name. This fixes firmware loading issue with Airgo networks
  driver.
* When compiling with 2.6.19-rc2 and possibly next rc(s), compile with
  'make USE_OWN_WQ=1'. Final 2.6.19 may not need this (hopefully).

Version 1.27 2006-10-21
=======================
* Bug fix to drivers that load binary firmware files (broken in 1.26). This
  fixes issues with Atheros and TI drivers.
* Atheros PCI driver requests more map registers for DMA than limit specified
  in NDIS. Instead of failing such invalid requests, continue.

Version 1.26 2006-10-14
=======================
* Removed debug flag in ndiswrapper script
* When HIGHMEM is enabled, allocate and copy URB buffers only if
  necessary. This prevents memory allocation failures.

Version 1.25 2006-10-04
=======================
* Support for WE-21
* Bug fixes

Version 1.24 2006-10-01
=======================
* Compilation issues with 2.4 fixed (yet again!)
* Devices are recognized when they are inserted, instead of registering when
  module is loaded. With this, new Windows drivers can be installed / updated
  without unloading ndiswrapper module, and any number of Windows drivers can
  be installed without overhead.
* Minor tweaks and optimizations
* Fixed issues with RT-Preempt patch
* 64-bit RT2500 USB driver works

Version 1.23 2006-08-10
=======================
* Bug fixes to recent changes in 64-bit driver support.
* ZyDas ZD1211 driver uses interrupt-out URBs, so set them up properly.
* Bug fixes to Atheros USB driver support.

Version 1.22 2006-08-05
=======================
* Added support for Broadcom 802.11n (draft) driver
* Added support for 64-bit Marvell driver
* Optimizations for 64-bit drivers
* If network interface name changes (through udev, ifrename etc),
  ndiswrapper notices it and changes entry in procfs
* Compilation issue with 2.4 issue fixed

Version 1.21 2006-07-15
=======================
* Fix to a bug (in 1.20) that locked up when used with RT2500 with SMP.
* RT2500 is supported with 64-bit.

Version 1.20 2006-07-15
=======================
* Fixes to 64-bit drivers; TI 1450 (used in AVM Fritz) is supported with 64-bit.
* Fix to SMP kernel crash when USB device is unplugged.

Version 1.19 2006-07-02
=======================
* Calls to Miniport functions with serialized drivers (such as RT2500) are
  serialized, so they should work with SMP.
* Enable interrupts in IRQ handler; otherwise, some drivers (e.g., Marvell
  8335) don't work.
* Kernel crash with changing mac address (with 'ifconfig hw ether ...') fixed.

Version 1.18 2006-06-22
=======================
* Kernel crash with RT2500 (and possibly other serialized drivers) under heavy
  traffic load fixed.
* Support for RNDIS driver with Vista drivers for 64-bit added.

Version 1.17 2006-06-04
=======================
* netpoll support added; with this netconsole can be used with ndiswrapper.
* Suspend/resume improved: Until now devices are halted (which is similar to
  removing the device) during suspend and initialized during resume. Now,
  if a driver supports suspend and resume, that is used instead. With this,
  any wireless settings, such as encryption, may be preserved by the driver.
* Support for RNDIS was broken in 1.16; they work now.

Version 1.16 2006-05-06
=======================
* Compilation issues 2.4 kernels fixed.
* Support for lck patchset (Con Kolivas's preempt patch) for 2.4 kernels added.
* Added workqueue functions for 2.4 kernels so drivers that need more
  than one workqueue work.
* Added support for more USB devices with 2.4 kernels (so far, devices
  which use interrupt URBs, such as ZyDas ZD1211, didn't work; now
  some of them do).

Version 1.15 2006-04-26
=======================
* Memory allocation tracking support added; this should help find any
  memory leaks (with ALLOC_INFO and ALLOC_DEBUG options to 'make').
* Proper fix for drivers (Atheros PCI and USB drivers) allocating
  large chunk of memory in atomic context.
* Fix for crash when module is removed with new Atheros USB driver,
  which supports WPA2 and has no firmware driver (athfmwdl).
* Memory leaks plugged.
* Wireless statistics are enabled (inadvertently disabled in version 1.14).
* Suspend/resume issues fixed - all devices, including USB devices,
  should work with suspend/resume.
* Plugging/unplugging/rmmod issues fixed; Marvell devices don't need
  to be unplugged before removing module.

Version 1.14 2006-04-17
=======================
* Added support for Xpeed X400 ADSL adapter.
* Only wireless devices will be registered as wireless devices to
  kernel; others (e.g., X400 ADSL) will be registered as network
  devices, by default, with wlan%d.
* Issues with multicast fixed.
* Issues with ZyDas ZD1211 fixed (broken since 1.9 or so).
* Fixed memory corruption issues, discovered with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB.

Version 1.13 2006-04-08
=======================
* Compilation issues with older kernels fixed.
* SMP issues fixed; Netgear WG111 USB (Prism54 chipset) works with SMP.
* Association to open networks (without encryption) is supported with 'wext'
  driver interface with wpa_supplicant.
* Workaround is provided for Atheros driver so large block of memory
  allocated by this driver in atomic context succeed.

Version 1.12 2006-04-04
======================
* Sis163 USB driver with version 1.11 failed to associate reliably. This is
  fixed.
* TI 1450 USB driver failed to initialize card if module is reloaded. This is
  fixed.
* WPA with TKIP with TI ACX100 driver now works with 'ap_scan=2' in
  wpa_supplicant's configuration file. Driver for D-Link DWL-650+ has support
  for WPA with TKIP for this chipset.
* Added support for non-encrypted networks with wpa_supplicant.
* Am1772 with WPA and TKIP authenticates reliably now.
* Compilation issue with 2.4 kernels fixed.
* Added support for WEP with wpa_supplicant through 'wext' driver
  interface. There is no need for 'ndiswrapper' interface with wpa_supplicant
  anymore.
* Fixed an issue with 64-bit USB drivers. No 64-bit USB driver is known to
  work, though.

Version 1.11 2006-03-25
======================
* Added support for newer RNDIS (USB) cards (e.g., USR5421, F5D7051uk,
  WUSB54GSv2, all based on Broadcom chip). These support WPA2, whereas
  older RNDIS cards support only WPA.
* Kernel crash when removing USB cards fixed.
* Fixed performance issues with SMP.
* Added support for AMD Am1772.

Version 1.10 2006-02-11
======================
* Added support for 64-bit USB drivers. Not tested with any driver,
  though.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.9 2006-02-03
======================
* Added support for real-time preempt (RT) patch.
* Added support for TNETW1450 (TI's USB chipset).
* Added support for latest Windows Broadcom driver.
* Added support for Airgo Networks MIMO Pre-N driver.
* Added support for Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG driver; this driver needs 16KB
  stacks in kernel.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.8 2006-01-16
======================
* Issue with WEP with wpa_supplicant fixed (keys must be saved and
  restored).
* Support for newer kernels added.
* If USB support is not required, passing 'DISABLE_USB=1' option to
  'make' will not include USB layer (introduced in version 1.5, but
  broken in at least 1.7).
* Crash when removing ndiswrapper module with certain Windows drivers
  fixed.

Version 1.7 2005-12-07
======================
* Support for Atheros USB drivers natively (without the need for
  load_fw_ar5523 user space firmware layer introduced in 1.6 release) added.
* Drivers and driver files are dynamically loaded and unloaded as and when
  necessary; this should save memory.
* Bug fixes / improvements.

Version 1.6 2005-11-29
======================
* Support for Highmem with USB devices added.
* Bulk and interrupt URBs were being mixed up in earlier releases - this issue
  is fixed.
* Crashes due to 'divide by zero' error in update_wireless_stats fixed.
* Added support for Atheros USB drivers including RangeMAX MIMO. This
  requires loading ar5523.bin firmware file with user-space tool
  load_fw_ar5523 in utils.
* Suspend and resume support improved; USB devices should now be able
  to suspend and resume.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.5 2005-10-30
======================
* SMP issues fixed.
* Zero-copy for sending packets implemented.
* It is possible to compile ndiswrapper even if USB is not enabled in
  kernel, without support for USB devices.
* Even if USB is enabled in kernel, ndiswrapper can be compiled with
  'make DISABLE_USB=1' to disable support for USB devices.
* If a device doesn't resume properly (from suspend), de-initialize
  device so it can be initialized later. This fixes issue with
  suspend/resume with Marvell driver.
* Issues with WUSB11v4 (Ali chipset) fixed.
* Rtl string functions have been reimplemented.
* Resume from suspend works with Marvell chipset 8335.

Version 1.4 2005-10-06
======================
* WPA2 support added.
* Implemented most of IO manager, PnP manager and Obj manager.
* No need to update utils every time ndiswrapper is updated but only when utils
  interface changes.
* USB layer has been rewritten with many fixes; e.g., USB devices no
  longer disconnect unexpectedly.
* New devices supported: sis162, sis163, ZyDas 1211, Linksys WUSB11v4
  (with Ali chipset). These are USB devices.
* Unplugging USB devices without removing ndiswrapper module
  supported.
* USB devices work with PREEMPT enabled.
* Separate workqueue is used in 2.6 kernels; this should prevent
  locking up keyboard etc. in case of kernel crash.
* Support for new kernels added.
* Many bug fixes.
* Added support for Inprocomm IPN2220 with 64-bit.
* Added support for RNDIS USB devices (tested with U.S. Robotics
  USR5420).
* Issue with unloading module with some drivers (e.g., sis and
  Inprocomm ipn2220) fixed.
* Issue with WPA with sis162u, sis163u and ZyDas zd1211 fixed.
* Initialization failure with WUSB54v1 fixed.

Version 1.2 2005-06-10
======================
* Support for NX (no-execute) bit
* 64-bit Broadcom driver works with HIGHMEM.
* Implemented I/O manager and Object layers.
* Many bug fixes

Version 1.1 2005-03-04
======================
* Free kmem_cache of MDLs; this fixes crashes when removing module.
* Yet another spinlock (re)implementation. We don't use Linux spinlocks to
  implement Windows spinlocks anymore - ndiswrapper implements new spinlock
  functions that use Windows spinlock variables directly.
* Use kmem_cache pools for MDL (aka NDIS_BUFFER) and NDIS_PACKET structures
  which are allocated often. This should reduce memory fragmentation.
* Use MDL functions when initializing ndis_packet while sending packets. This
  fixes crashes with Fedora kernels (and amd64 driver at least).
* Memory leak with 64-bit Broadcom driver fixed
* Crash when module is removed with Marvell driver fixed
* In some cases, a Windows driver loads successfully, but ndiswrapper
  concludes otherwise. This is fixed.
* Don't use spinlocks unless CONFIG_SMP or CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is
  enabled.
* Don't reset Centrino cards during initialization as this seems to
  turns off radio.
* 2.4 kernels don't have hashing, so provide wrapper macros for hashing.
* Set the active/transmit key index as given, instead of assuming 1
  always. This fixes authentication with Cisco routers. This should
  also fix WEP issues when active key used on the router is at index > 1.
* NdisAcquire(Dpr)SpinLock obtains the lock at DISPATCH_LEVEL instead
  of PASSIVE_LEVEL. This fixes PREEMPT and SMP issues with some drivers.
* Issue with Prism54 driver sometimes crashing kernel when scanning fixed.
* Added private ioctl to set the network type to a specific type. Use
  "iwpriv wlan0 network_type <char>" to set the network type to what <char>
  represents, where <char> is one of a, b, g or any other character.
  For example, to set to 802.11b, use "iwpriv wlan0 network_type b",
  and to set to auto, "iwpriv wlan0 network_type x".

Version 1.0 2005-01-29
======================
* Yet another spinlock reimplementation. Since I don't have SMP, it is taking
  lot of time (and effort) to get it working.
* With new spinlock implementation, CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK option can be
  enabled in the kernel.
* WavePlus 1200 chipset supported.
* Works with some vendor kernels that use different semantics (from vanilla
  kernels) for PCI/USB register functions.
* Don't free memory allocated for 'devices' twice (which was causing kernel
  crash) when device registration failed.
* Don't set infrastructure mode in wpa_associate, which clears the keys.
  With this, WEP should work again with wpa_supplicant.
* Fix (small) memory leak - free xmit_array when device is removed.
* Use spinlock when calling any miniport function. This may fix some SMP
  issues.
* Preliminary support for AMD64 (tested with Broadcom chipset)
* Dynamic loader support: A driver is loaded only when necessary, so
  even if many drivers are installed or if a driver installs many
  .conf files (e.g., Centrino), only drivers and device configurations
  necessary are loaded.
* Set RadioState used by Broadcom drivers to 0, instead of 1. This
  turns on radio (although name suggests the other way round).
* Bug fixes
* Workaround for CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, but this option is discouraged
* task_nice is not used anymore, so should compile with kernels where
  this is not exported
* More spinlock correction. Some drivers are reported to work with
  SMP. Not all drivers may work (at least Prism54 USB driver seems to
  be buggy)
* Spinlock rewrite: This time SMP should work. Really.
* Sends multiple packets (if driver supports it) in each send
  operation for better efficiency
* Most of the functionality of loader is moved to userspace tool
  loadndisdriver so it is more robust
* Encryption info is restored during disassociation; this is useful if
  ad-hoc mode is used as pseudo master mode
* MAC address can be set in .conf files (in /etc/ndiswrapper/<driver>
  directory) or changed at any time (with 'ifconfig hw class' command)
* Association and disassociation should happen quickly especially with
  wpa_supplicant
* Compilation issues with old gcc and sed are fixed
* Kernel crash when ejecting cards with cardctl in 2.4 kernels is
  fixed

Version 0.12 2004-11-25
=======================
* Works with Preempt and SMP kernels.
* WPA-RADIUS is supported.
* Compiles with kernels > 2.6.9 and swsuspend2
* USB cards are reset during initialization; they should work without
  having to reset explicitly
* Some crashes in USB, especially during initialization, are fixed.
* WEP key setting problems fixed.
* Check for 4K stack size during compilation and issue warning if necessary.
* Bug fixes

Version 0.11 2004-10-08
=======================
* Compilation issues with USB are fixed.
* WPA issues fixed.
* Older Prism USB devices (e.g., D-Link DWL-122, Netgear MA111) supported.
* Suspend/resume of devices with no power management (e.g., TI) fixed.
* ndiswrapper script has an option "-d" to install drivers for a
  different device (if the chipset is same); the script also installs
  drivers properly when the CopyFiles section has commented out file names.
* ndiswrapper script lists USB devices and reports status of drivers
  with more understandable messages.
* Many bug fixes and improvements

Version 0.10 2004-08-20
=======================
* Centrino 2200: works in ad-hoc mode, keyboard doesn't lock even
  when there is no power to the card, suspend/resume works, restricted
  mode encryption works
* SMP should work again
* USB cards are supported (only Linksys WUSB54G tested with 2.6.7 kernel)
* From now on, utils should be installed along with the module - newer version
  of module doesn't work with older version of utils
* hangcheck_interval option is no longer required; this option may be dropped
  in future versions
* suspend/resume work with procfs interface: e.g., to suspend
    echo suspend=3 > /proc/net/ndiswrapper/wlan0/settings
  and to resume
    echo resume > /proc/net/ndiswrapper/wlan0/settings

Version 0.9 2004-08-05
======================
* Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is supported with both AES/CCMP and TKIP
  encryption
* Debian packages can be built with 'make deb'; RPMs can be built with
  'make rpm'
* Support for RT2400/RT2500 chipset
* ndiswrapper script can be used to install INF files in Unicode
* Private ioctl to change power profile to AC/Battery
* Many bug fixes

Version 0.8 2004-06-10
======================
* Support for 802.1x (multiple WEP keys).
* Support for more chipsets/cards (DWL-G630, Marvell W8100, Atheros 5211,
  Atheros 5212).
* Many bug fixes (scanning, DMA aka shared memory allocation, timers, IRQs,
  spinlocks, memory allocation, serialized drivers).
* Added hangcheck_interval module option to either disable it (some Realtek
  drivers seem to have problems with it) or force it to any given value.

* New simpler installation.
* Better support for multiple driver and cards.
* Compiles on some more kernels.
* Suspend/resume follow new power management driver model and work with S3/S4.
* Power up the card during initialization so ndiswrapper works if the card is in
  powered down state.
* Background AP scanning is removed, so it doesn't affect IP traffic anymore.
* WEP key and essid can be set in any order, not necessarily key first and
  essid later.
* Essid is set twice with a delay in between so that it gets set properly
  the first time after the machine is booted.
* A new util for controlling the radio for Averatec 5110HX laptop added.

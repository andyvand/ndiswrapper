Version 1.16 2006-XX-XX
=======================
* Compilation issues 2.4 kernels fixed.
* Support for lck pathset (Con Kolivas's preempt patch) for 2.4 kernels added.

Version 1.15 2006-04-26
=======================
* Memory allocation tracking support added; this should help find any
  memory leaks (with ALLOC_INFO and ALLOC_DEBUG options to 'make').
* Proper fix for drivers (Atheros PCI and USB drivers) allocating
  large chunk of memory in atomic context.
* Fix for crash when module is removed with new Atheros USB driver,
  which supports WPA2 and has no firmware driver (athfmwdl).
* Memory leaks plugged.
* Wireless statistics are enabled (inadvertantly disabled in version 1.14).
* Suspend/resume issues fixed - all devices, including USB devices,
  should work with suspend/resume.
* Plugging/unplugging/rmmod issues fixed; Marvell devices don't need
  to be unplugged before removing module.

Version 1.14 2006-04-17
=======================
* Added support for Xpeed X400 ADSL adapter.
* Only wireless devices will be registered as wireless devices to
  kernel; others (e.g., X400 ADSL) will be registered as network
  devices, by default, with wlan%d.
* Issues with multicasting fixed.
* Issues with ZyDas ZD1211 fixed (broken since 1.9 or so).
* Fixed memory corruption issues, discovered with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB.

Version 1.13 2006-04-08
=======================
* Compilation issues with older kernels fixed.
* SMP issues fixed; Netgear WG111 USB (Prism54 chipset) works with SMP.
* Association to open networks (without encryption) is supported with 'wext'
  driver interface with wpa_supplicant.
* Workaround is provided for Atheros driver so large block of memory
  allocated by this driver in atomic context succeed.

Version 1.12 2006-04-04
======================
* Sis163 USB driver with version 1.11 failed to associate reliably. This is
  fixed.
* TI 1450 USB driver failed to initialize card if module is reloaded. This is
  fixed.
* WPA with TKIP with TI ACX100 driver now works with 'ap_scan=2' in
  wpa_supplicant's configuration file. Driver for D-Link DWL-650+ has support
  for WPA with TKIP for this chipset.
* Added support for non-encrypted networks with wpa_supplicant.
* Am1772 with WPA and TKIP authenticates reliably now.
* Compilation issue with 2.4 kernels fixed.
* Added support for WEP with wpa_supplicant through 'wext' driver
  interface. There is no need for 'ndiswrapper' interface with wpa_supplicant
  anymore.
* Fixed an issue with 64-bit USB drivers. No 64-bit USB driver is known to
  work, though.

Version 1.11 2006-03-25
======================
* Added support for newer RNDIS (USB) cards (e.g., USR5421, F5D7051uk,
  WUSB54GSv2, all based on Broadcom chip). These support WPA2, whereas
  older RNDIS cards support only WPA.
* Kernel crash when removing USB cards fixed.
* Fixed performance issues with SMP.
* Added support for AMD Am1772.

Version 1.10 2006-02-11
======================
* Added support for 64-bit USB drivers. Not tested with any driver,
  though.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.9 2006-02-03
======================
* Added support for real-time preempt (RT) patch.
* Added support for TNETW1450 (TI's USB chipset).
* Added support for latest Windows Broadcom driver.
* Added support for Airgo Networks MIMO Pre-N driver.
* Added support for Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG driver; this driver needs 16KB
  stacks in kernel.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.8 2006-01-16
======================
* Issue with WEP with wpa_supplicant fixed (keys must be saved and
  restored).
* Support for newer kernels added.
* If USB support is not required, passing 'DISABLE_USB=1' option to
  'make' will not include USB layer (introduced in version 1.5, but
  broken in at least 1.7).
* Crash when removing ndiswrapper module with certain Windows drivers
  fixed.

Version 1.7 2005-12-07
======================
* Support for Atheros USB drivers natively (without the need for
  load_fw_ar5523 user space firmware layer introduced in 1.6 release) added.
* Drivers and driver files are dynamically loaded and unloaded as and when
  necessary; this should save memory.
* Bug fixes / improvements.

Version 1.6 2005-11-29
======================
* Support for Highmem with USB devices added.
* Bulk and interrupt URBs were being mixed up in earlier releases - this issue
  is fixed.
* Crashes due to 'divide by zero' error in update_wireless_stats fixed.
* Support for Atheros USB drivers, including RangeMAX MIMO,  added. This
  requires loading ar5523.bin firmware file with user-space tool
  load_fw_ar5523 in utils.
* Suspend and resume support improved; USB devices should now be able
  to suspend and resume.
* Bug fixes.

Version 1.5 2005-10-30
======================
* SMP issues fixed.
* Zero-copy for sending packets implemented.
* It is possible to compile ndiswrapper even if USB is not enabled in
  kernel, without support for USB devices.
* Even if USB is enabled in kernel, ndiswrapper can be compiled with
  'make DISABLE_USB=1' to disable support for USB devices.
* If a device doesn't resume properly (from suspend), de-initialize
  device so it can be initialized later. This fixes issue with
  suspend/resume with Marvell driver.
* Issues with WUSB11v4 (Ali chipset) fixed.
* Rtl string functions have been reimplemented.
* Resume from suspend works with Marvell chipset 8335.

Version 1.4 2005-10-06
======================
* WPA2 support added.
* Implemented most of IO manager, PnP manager and Obj manager.
* No need to update utils everytime ndiswrapper is updated but only when utils
  interface changes.
* USB layer has been rewritten with many fixes; e.g., USB devices no
  longer disconnect unexpectedly.
* New devices supported: sis162, sis163, ZyDas 1211, Linksys WUSB11v4
  (with Ali chipset). These are USB devices.
* Unplugging USB devices without removing ndiswrapper module
  supported.
* USB devices work with PREEMPT enabled.
* Separate workqueue is used in 2.6 kernels; this should prevent
  locking up keyboard etc. in case of kernel crash.
* Support for new kernels added.
* Many bug fixes.
* Added support for Inprocomm IPN2220 with 64-bit.
* Added support for RNDIS USB devices (tested with U.S. Robotics
  USR5420).
* Issue with unloading module with some drirvers (e.g., sis and
  Inprocomm ipn2220) fixed.
* Issue with WPA with sis162u, sis163u and ZyDas zd1211 fixed.
* Initialization failure with WUSB54v1 fixed.

Version 1.2 2005-06-10
======================
* Support for NX (no-execute) bit
* 64-bit Broadcom driver works with HIGHMEM.
* Implemented I/O manager and Object layers.
* Many bug fixes

Versoin 1.1 2005-03-04
======================
* Free kmem_cache of MDLs; this fixes crashes when removing module.
* Yet another spinlock (re)implementation. We don't use Linux spinlocks to
  implement Windows spinlocks anymore - ndiswrapper implements new spinlock
  functions that use Windows spinlock variables directly.
* Use kmem_cache pools for MDL (aka NDIS_BUFFER) and NDIS_PACKET structures
  which are allocated often. This should reduce memory fragmentation.
* Use MDL functions when initializing ndis_packet while sending packets. This
  fixes crashes with Fedora kernels (and amd64 driver at least).
* Memory leak with 64-bit Broadcom driver fixed
* Crash when module is removed with Marvell driver fixed
* In some cases, a Windows driver loads successfully, but ndiswrapper
  concludes otherwise. This is fixed.
* Don't use spinlocks unless CONFIG_SMP or CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is
  enabled.
* Don't reset Centrino cards during initialization as this seems to
  turns off radio.
* 2.4 kernels don't have hashing, so provide wrapper macros for hashing.
* Set the active/transmit key index as given, instead of assuming 1
  always. This fixes authentication with Cisco routers. This should
  also fix WEP issues when active key used on the router is at index > 1.
* NdisAcquire(Dpr)SpinLock obtains the lock at DISPATCH_LEVEL instead
  of PASSIVE_LEVEL. This fixes PREEMPT and SMP issues with some drivers.
* Issue with Prism54 driver sometimes crashing kernel when scanning fixed.
* Added private ioctl to set the network type to a specific type. Use
  "iwpriv wlan0 network_type <char>" to set the network type to what <char>
  represents, where <char> is one of a, b, g or any other characther.
  For example, to set to 802.11b, use "iwpriv wlan0 network_type b",
  and to set to auto, "iwpriv wlan0 network_type x".

Version 1.0 2005-01-29
======================
* Yet another spinlock reimplementation. Since I don't have SMP, it is taking
  lot of time (and effort) to get it working.
* With new spinlock implementation, CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK option can be
  enabled in the kernel.
* WavePlus 1200 chipset supported.
* Works with some vendor kernels that use different semantcis (from vanilla
  kernels) for PCI/USB register functions.
* Don't free memory allocated for 'devices' twice (which was causing kernel
  crash) when device registration failed.
* Don't set infrastructure mode in wpa_associate, which clears the keys.
  With this, WEP should work again with wpa_supplicant.
* Fix (small) memory leak - free xmit_array when device is removed.
* Use spinlock when calling any miniport function. This may fix some SMP
  issues.
* Preliminary support for AMD64 (tested with Broadcom chipset)
* Dynamic loader support: A driver is loaded only when necessary, so
  even if many drivers are installed or if a driver installs many
  .conf files (e.g., Centrino), only drivers and device configurations
  necessary are loaded.
* Set RadioState used by Broadcom drivers to 0, instead of 1. This
  turns on radio (although name suggets the other way round).
* Bug fixes
* Workaround for CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, but this option is discouraged
* task_nice is not used anymore, so should compile with kernels where
  this is not exported
* More spinlock correction. Some drivers are reported to work with
  SMP. Not all drivers may work (at least Prism54 USB driver seems to
  be buggy)
* Spinlock rewrite: This time SMP should work. Really.
* Sends multiple packets (if driver supports it) in each send
  operation for better efficiency
* Most of the functionality of loader is moved to userspace tool
  loadndisdriver so it is more robust
* Encryption info is restored during disassociation; this is useful if
  ad-hoc mode is used as psuedo master mode
* MAC address can be set in .conf files (in /etc/ndiswrapper/<driver>
  directory) or changed at any time (with 'ifconfig hw class' command)
* Association and disassociation should happen quickly especially with
  wpa_supplicant
* Compilation issues with old gcc and sed are fixed
* Kernel crash when ejecting cards with cardctl in 2.4 kernels is
  fixed

Version 0.12 2004-11-25
=======================
* Works with Preempt and SMP kernels.
* WPA-RADIUS is supported.
* Compiles with kernels > 2.6.9 and swsuspend2
* USB cards are reset during initialization; they should work without
  having to reset explicitly
* Some crashes in USB, especially during initialization, are fixed.
* WEP key setting problems fixed.
* Check for 4K stack size during compilation and issue warning if necessary.
* Bug fixes

Version 0.11 2004-10-08
=======================
* Compilation issues with USB are fixed.
* WPA issues fixed.
* Older Prism USB devices (e.g., Dlink DWL-122, Netgear MA111)  supported.
* Suspend/resume of devices with no power management (e.g., TI) fixed.
* ndiswrapper script has an option "-d" to install drivers for a
  different device (if the chipset is same); the script also installs
  drivers properly when the CopyFiles section has commented out file names.
* ndiswrapper script lists USB devices and reports status of drivers
  with more understandable messages.
* Many bug fixes and improvements

Version 0.10 2004-08-20
=======================
* Centrino 2200: works in ad-hoc mode, keyboard doesn't lock even
  when there is no power to the card, suspend/resume works, restricted
  mode encryption works
* SMP should work again
* USB cards are supported (only Linksys WUSB54G tested with 2.6.7 kernel)
* From now on, utils should be installed along with the module - newer version
  of module doesn't work with older version of utils
* hangcheck_interval option is no longer required; this option may be dropped
  in future versions
* suspend/resume work with procfs interface: e.g., to suspend
    echo suspend=3 > /proc/net/ndiswrapper/wlan0/settings
  and to resume
    echo resume > /proc/net/ndiswrapper/wlan0/settings

Version 0.9 2004-08-05
======================
* Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is supported with both AES/CCMP and TKIP
  encryption
* Debian packages can be built with 'make deb'; RPMs can be built with
  'make rpm'
* Support for RT2400/RT2500 chipset
* ndiswrapper script can be used to install INF files in Unicode
* Private ioctl to change power profile to AC/Battery
* Many bug fixes

Version 0.8 2004-06-10
======================
* Support for 802.1x (multiple wep keys).
* Support for more chipsets/cards (DWL-G630, Marvell W8100, Atheros 5211,
  Atheros 5212).
* Many bug fixes (scanning, dma aka shared memory allocation, timers, irqs,
  spinlocks, memory allocation, serialized drivers).
* Added hangcheck_interval module option to either disable it (some realtek
  drivers seem to have problems with it) or force it to any given value.

Version 0.7 2004-04-23
======================
* Power down while unloading the module, so it saves trees!
* Fixed a bug with scanning; earlier it would fail sometimes.
* procfs exposes multiple cards, if present.
* Fixed problems with unloading of module in some cases.
* Realtek 8180L is supported.
* Support for more cards/chips (see "Supported Chipsets" page for details).
* Many bug fixes!

* New simpler installation.
* Better support for multiple driver and cards.
* Compiles on some more kernels.
* Suspend/resume follow new power management driver model and work with S3/S4.
* Powerup the card during initializtion so ndiswrapper works if the card is in
  powered down state.
* Background AP scanning is removed, so it doesn't affect IP traffic anymore.
* WEP key and essid can be set in any order, not necessarily key first and
  essid later.
* Essid is set twice with a delay in between so that it gets set properly
  the first time after the machine is booted.
* A new util for controlling the radio for Averatec 5110HX laptop added.

Version 0.4 2004-01-05
======================
* Admtek chipset works, including WEP.
* Performance issues on Centrino have been fixed.
* Removing the module doesn't give oops anymore.
* Power management (suspend/resume) works reliably.

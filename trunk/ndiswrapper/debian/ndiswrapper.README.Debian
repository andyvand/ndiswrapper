ndiswrapper for Debian
----------------------

Please see ./README for a description of the ndiswrapper software.

I use the following setup of ndiswrapper:

Add this to your /etc/networking/interfaces::
  
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
     pre-up modprobe ndiswrapper
     post-down rmmod ndiswrapper
 
If you have several wlan adapters in your computer you may need to change
wlan0 to something else.

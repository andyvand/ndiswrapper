##### Example wpa_supplicant configuration file ###############################
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

# NOTE! This file may contain password information and should probably be made
# readable only by root user on multiuser systems.

# global configuration (shared by all network blocks)
#
# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, wpa_supplicant
# will create a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests from external
# programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and configuration. Access
# control for this control interface can be configured by creating the socket
# in a directory that is readable only for desired users.
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version
# wpa_supplicant was implemented based on IEEE 802-1X-REV-d8 which defines
# EAPOL version 2. However, there are many APs that do not handle the new
# version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely). In order
# to make wpa_supplicant interoperate with these APs, the version number is set
# to 1 by default. This configuration value can be used to set it to the new
# version (2).
eapol_version=1

# network block
#
# Each network (usually AP's sharing the same SSID) is configured as a separate
# block in this configuration file. The network blocks are in preference order
# (the first match is used).
#
# network block fields:
#
# ssid: SSID (mandatory); either as an ASCII string with double quotation or
#	as hex string; network name
#
# scan_ssid:
#	0 = do not scan this SSID with specific Probe Request frames (default)
#	1 = scan with SSID-specific Probe Request frames (this can be used to
#	    find APs that do not accept broadcast SSID or use multiple SSIDs;
#	    this will add latency to scanning, so enable this only when needed)
#
# bssid: BSSID (optional); if set, this network block is used only when
#	associating with the AP using the configured BSSID
#
# proto: list of accepted protocols
# WPA = WPA/IEEE 802.11i/D3.0
# RSN = WPA2/IEEE 802.11i (also WPA2 can be used as an alias for RSN)
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA RSN
#
# key_mgmt: list of accepted authenticated key management protocols
# WPA-PSK = WPA pre-shared key (this requires 'psk' field)
# WPA-EAP = WPA using EAP authentication (this can use an external
#	program, e.g., Xsupplicant, for IEEE 802.1X EAP Authentication
# IEEE8021X = IEEE 802.1X using EAP authentication and (optionally) dynamically
#	generated WEP keys
# NONE = WPA is not used; plaintext or static WEP could be used (note: this is
#	not currently supported)
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA-PSK WPA-EAP
#
# pairwise: list of accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# NONE = Use only Group Keys (deprecated, should not be included if APs support
#	pairwise keys)
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP
#
# group: list of accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# WEP104 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 104-bit key
# WEP40 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 40-bit key [IEEE 802.11]
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40
#
# psk: WPA preshared key; 256-bit pre-shared key
# The key used in WPA-PSK mode can be entered either as 64 hex-digits, i.e.,
# 32 bytes or as an ASCII passphrase (in which case, the real PSK will be
# generated using the passphrase and SSID). ASCII passphrase must be between
# 8 and 63 characters (inclusive).
# This field is not needed, if WPA-EAP is used.
# Note: Separate tool, wpa_passphrase, can be used to generate 256-bit keys
# from ASCII passphrase. This process uses lot of CPU and wpa_supplicant
# startup and reconfiguration time can be optimized by generating the PSK only
# only when the passphrase or SSID has actually changed.
#
# Following fields are only used with internal EAP implementation.
# eap: space-separated list of accepted EAP methods
#	MD5 = EAP-MD5 (unsecure and does not generate keying material ->
#			cannot be used with WPA)
#       MSCHAPV2 = EAP-MSCHAPv2 (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP)
#	TLS = EAP-TLS (client and server certificate)
#	PEAP = EAP-PEAP (with tunnelled MSCHAPV2)
#	TTLS = EAP-TTLS (with tunnelled EAP-MD5-Challenge)
#	If not set, all compiled in methods are allowed.
#
# identity: Identity string for EAP
# anonymous_identity: Anonymous identity string for EAP (to be used as the
#	unencrypted identity with EAP types that support different tunnelled
#	identity, e.g., EAP-TTLS)
# password: Password string for EAP
# ca_cert: File path to CA certificate file. This file can have one or more
#	trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert is not included, server certificate
#	will not be verified. This is insecure and the CA file should always be
#	configured.
# client_cert: File path to client certificate file
# private_key: File path to client private key file
# private_key_passwd: Password for private key file
# phase1: Phase1 (outer authentication, i.e., TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "peapver=0")
# phase2: Phase2 (inner authentication with TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "auth=MSCHAPV2")
# Following certificate/private key fields are used in inner Phase2
# authentication when using EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP.
# ca_cert2: File path to CA certificate file. This file can have one or more
#	trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert2 is not included, server
#	certificate will not be verified. This is insecure and the CA file
#	should always be configured.
# client_cert2: File path to client certificate file
# private_key2: File path to client private key file
# private_key2_passwd: Password for private key file

To do:
- add WPA support to Linux Wireless Extensions
- add support for other drivers
- port for *BSD
- implement GUI for WPA Supplicant/Xsupplicant/iwconfig/iwlist
  (easy to use configuration and network stats, etc.)
- add support for TLS session resumption / fast reconnect
- EAP-TLS/TTLS/PEAP: add option for verifying authsrv identity (certificate
  CN?); could also verify certificate use fields ("server authentication" or
  all uses); verify CRL after connection has been initialized
- add support for opportunistic PMKSA caching
- hostap: try other roaming modes
- EAP-MSCHAPv2: add support for password changing
- add support for WPA with ap_scan=0 (update selected cipher etc. based on
  AssocInfo; make sure these match with configuration)
- add driver interface for using wpa_supplicant with wired interface
  (or a separate program using EAPOL library)
- EAP-AKA
- EAP-FAST

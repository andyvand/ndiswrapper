To do:
- add WPA support to Linux Wireless Extensions
- add support for other drivers
- port for *BSD
- implement GUI for WPA Supplicant/Xsupplicant/iwconfig/iwlist
  (easy to use configuration and network stats, etc.)
- change wpa_supplicant.c to use wpa_eapol_send() instead of generating
  Ethernet and IEEE 802.1X headers in many places (?)
  (this is a bit complicated, because WPA include IEEE 802.1X header in
  EAPOL-Key MIC calculation)
- add support for plaintext connection (i.e., no WPA and no IEEE 802.1X)
- add support for TLS session resumption / fast reconnect
- new IEEE 802.11i implementation recommendation:
  * SNonce should always be made random (i.e., do not use global counter
  * incremented by one. In addition, SNonce should only be updated
  * after msg 3/4 has been successfully processed.
  * Actually, would be better to add a flag that will make msg 1/4
  * processing update SNonce, so that possible retries of 3/4 will use
  * the same SNonce..
- EAP-GTC: add option to always ask for new password (i.e., do not cache
  previous password)
- EAP-TLS/TTLS/PEAP: add option for verifying authsrv identity (certificate
  CN?); could also verify certificate use fields ("server authentication" or
  all uses); verify CRL after connection has been initialized
- add support for opportunistic PMKSA caching
- hostap: try other roaming modes
- EAP-SIM - GSM/SIM (smart card) interface
- EAP-MSCHAPv2: add support for password changing
